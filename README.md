공식문서로 제대로 공부하자. 영어공부도 하고 일석이조구만

8. Compound statements¶
Compound statements contain (groups of) other statements; they affect or control the execution of those other statements in some way. In general, compound statements span multiple lines, although in simple incarnations a whole compound statement may be contained in one line.

The if, while and for statements implement traditional control flow constructs. try specifies exception handlers and/or cleanup code for a group of statements, while the with statement allows the execution of initialization and finalization code around a block of code. Function and class definitions are also syntactically compound statements.

A compound statement consists of one or more ‘clauses.’ A clause consists of a header and a ‘suite.’ 
The clause headers of a particular compound statement are all at the same indentation level. 
Each clause header begins with a uniquely identifying keyword and ends with a colon. 
A suite is a group of statements controlled by a clause. 
A suite can be one or more semicolon-separated simple statements on the same line as the header, following the header’s colon, or 
it can be one or more indented statements on subsequent lines. 
Only the latter form of a suite can contain nested compound statements; the following is illegal, 
mostly because it wouldn’t be clear to which if clause a following else clause would belong:
